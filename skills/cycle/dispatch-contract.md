# Dispatch contract

The block below is pasted, filled in, at the top of **every** agent dispatch in a GoodReason cycle.
It exists because the coordinator retyping these rules from memory drops one each time: in the
2026-09-23 four-defect run the `git stash` ban and the line-length limit were both missing from
the first Implementer prompt and had to be added in the second.

Fill the `<…>` slots. Delete nothing; if a rule does not apply, say so in the slot.

```
## Environment
- Work ONLY in <worktree path> (branch <name>, based on <upstream ref> <sha>). It has a working <venv/toolchain>.
- <main checkout path> is READ-ONLY. Do not grep callers there: untracked files invent call sites.
- Your scratch directory is <scratch root>/<agent name>/ — create it; every file you produce goes there.
- Never `git stash` in any worktree of this repository. The stash list is shared across worktrees; a failed
  push followed by a pop applies another branch's work. Compare against `git show HEAD:<path>` copies instead.
- Commit only if this brief says so. Default: the coordinator commits after Evolution's verdict.
- Run tests with: <exact command>. Baseline measured by the coordinator: <command> → <N passed, M skipped>.
- Lint config is <path, e.g. .flake8>: <the limits that matter, e.g. max-line-length 100>. Keep every new or
  changed line inside them.
- Siblings: <names of agents running in parallel and what they own>. Coordinate with them directly via
  SendMessage when you find shared ground, and write the agreed points as an addendum to your own file.

## Evidence
- A claim that a check passed carries the command and one line of its real output. An empty diff between
  two tool outputs proves nothing if both are the same error message. Do not claim a check you did not run.
- Mark every claim [M] measured (you ran or read it at the cited line) or [I] inferred.
- Report where reality differed from the plan as its own section. Do not absorb the difference.

## Handoff
- Write the full report to <scratch root>/<agent name>/<file>.md. It is the primary channel and is readable
  the moment it is written; your final message may arrive hours later.
- Your final message is a summary of at most 40 lines that points at the file. Do not also send the same
  content to the coordinator through SendMessage: the harness already delivers your final message.
- Report exact line counts (`wc -l`) and `git diff --stat` for anything you changed. A later foreign edit
  to an untracked file is only detectable against that number.
```

## Role-specific additions

Append the matching block after the shared block.

### Strategist

```
## Gate 0
1. Confirm the baseline above for the areas you touch. If you share the worktree with siblings, run tests
   with `-p no:cacheprovider`; a single failure that passes alone is contention, not a finding.
2. Verify every code claim in the input (report, ticket, prior handoff) against the code with file:line.
   Treat each citation as a hypothesis: confirm the *call path* that produces the symptom, not only that
   the cited function exists.
3. Reproduce the mechanism on a synthetic fixture with the real code, and state which of the reported
   instances the fixture reproduces and which it does not.

## Deliver
- Competing hypotheses (≥ 3) for cause and fix locus, each with evidence, falsification and the cheapest test.
- Every code path that can produce the symptom, not only the one the report names.
- Existing tests that pin adjacent behaviour, and what a regression test must pin.
- α check: the minimum that satisfies the consumer of this fix, and what is a follow-up.
```

### Architect

```
## Plan
- Commit order with the conflict analysis for every shared region; when two phases edit one function,
  the earlier phase carves the seam and the later fills it, and you name the test that must fail if the
  seam is removed.
- Per phase: characterization tests (green on base), regression tests (red on base), fix (green). For each
  regression test say whether it CAN be red on base; a test that cannot is a guard against the wrong fix,
  label it as one.
- Pre-registered acceptance deltas AND the fixture that produces them. A delta the fixture cannot show is
  a prediction nobody can check.
- Test commands and expected counts; tests read only paths the test image mounts.
- For every open question, propose a default so the coordinator answers by exception.
```

### Implementer

```
## Per phase (report evidence for each)
1. Characterization tests → run → GREEN, with the count.
2. Regression tests → run → RED, quoting the failing assertion. If a planned-red test is green on base,
   say so and keep it as a guard.
3. Fix → run → GREEN; then the full sets from the contract.
4. Mutation-check your own guards before handoff: remove each clause on a copy, name the test that fails,
   restore and verify with `cmp`. Evolution then verifies instead of discovering.
5. Read the repo's real lint config before claiming lint results, and cite it.
In autonomous mode (ring ≤ 3) run the steps without returning; the Step Log carries the same evidence.
Do not combine steps into one edit.
```

### Evolution

```
## Assess
1. Right fix for the right reason: does the mechanism match what the Strategist measured?
2. Tests: on a scratch copy with only the tests applied, which are red? Mutate each guard; report the
   mutations no test catches as required tests for the next phase.
3. Disconnections between goal, plan, code and claims. Verify every "passed" claim from its command and
   output; a claim without output is unverified.
4. Side effects, not only behaviour: new log lines, import-time prints, new warnings, changed exit codes,
   resource use. (A logger misconfiguration survived three behaviour-only reviews on 2026-09-23.)
5. At least once per branch, run the real thing end-to-end on real data against the base and diff the
   result sets. The only design flaw in the 2026-09-23 branch was visible only on a real repository.
6. Put must-fix items first. Anything that is a defect, however small, is an item, not a footnote.
Verdict: CONTINUE / FIX-FIRST (exact list) / RETURN-TO-<role>.
